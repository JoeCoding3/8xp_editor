## An editor for .8xp program files.
### This is only tested with the TI-83 Plus, but it should work with files from other calculators too.
**Note: Since this tool is still in development, it can only *read* .8xp files, not *write* .8xp files.**

<br><br>
*I found documentation for the file format [here](https://merthsoft.com/linkguide/ti83+/fformat.html) and [here](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/tokens), but all the code in this repo is my own.*
