## An editor for .8xp TI-BASIC files
### This is made for the TI-83 Plus, but it probably works with files from other calculators.
**Note: Since this tool is still in development, it can only *read* .8xp files, not *write* .8xp files.**

*I found documentation for the file format [here](https://merthsoft.com/linkguide/ti83+/fformat.html), but all the code in this repo is my own.*
